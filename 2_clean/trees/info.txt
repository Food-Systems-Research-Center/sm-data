- refined_secondary_tree.csv is what we are using to identify the metrics we are actually using and applying to each indicator. It is used in the refined_metadata qmd file to make metrics_df, which are used throughout analysis.
- new_tree.csv is what we are using to reduce metrics, remove health stuff, prep for RFPP and then on to Frontiers submission
- frontiers_tree is for reworking metrics for frontiers submission. Making it accessible to others. The csv will be used for the SMDO page, while the xlsx is for making it accessible to others. Really the xlsx shouldn't stay here - it will be on OneDrive and just be used to update the csv.
