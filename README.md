# Sustainability Metrics Data

## About

> [!NOTE]
> This project is early in development. The framework, metrics, and analyses are all preliminary.
 
The Sustainability Metrics project is a collaborative effort to measure food system sustainability in New England led by the University of Vermont (UVM) UVM Food Systems Research Center (FSRC). We work with five teams of investigators conducting primary research in vital aspects of local and regional food systems. To support this work, we are also exploring secondary data sources. 

This repository houses an R project which collects, cleans, and compiles secondary data from a variety of sources in service of the Sustainability Metrics project. Clean exports of data are sent to [sm-docs](https://www.github.com/food-systems-research-center/sm-docs) and [sm-explorer](https://www.github.com/food-systems-research-center/sm-explorer).
